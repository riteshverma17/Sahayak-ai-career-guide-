        correctAnswer: 2,
        explanation: 'F = ma, so a = F/m. If F is doubled (2F) and m is halved (m/2), then a = 2F/(m/2) = 4F/m, so acceleration quadruples.'

        question: 'What is the speed of light in vacuum?',
        options: ['2.5 × 10⁸ m/s', '3 × 10⁸ m/s', '3.5 × 10⁸ m/s', '4 × 10⁸ m/s'],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation: 'The speed of light in vacuum is approximately 3 × 10⁸ m/s or 300,000 km/s, denoted by the constant c.'

        question: 'Which of the following is NOT a fundamental force of nature?',
        options: ['Gravitational force', 'Magnetic force', 'Strong nuclear force', 'Weak nuclear force'],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        explanation: 'Magnetic force is not a fundamental force. The four fundamental forces are: gravitational, electromagnetic (which includes magnetic force), strong nuclear, and weak nuclear forces.'

        question: 'What is the relationship between frequency and wavelength of a wave?',
        options: ['Frequency = Wavelength', 'Frequency × Wavelength = Speed of wave', 'Frequency = Speed of wave / Wavelength', 'Frequency + Wavelength = Constant'],
        correctAnswer: 2,
        explanation: 'The wave equation is v = f × λ, where v is speed, f is frequency, and λ is wavelength. Therefore, f = v/λ'
